# Banking-System

This is a demo Banking System with a frontend done in REACT js and backend using Java with Springboot. Data is being persisted in a local database MySQL.

Here is how to run this demo:
  - Need an IDE for both the frontend and backend. I am using Visual Studio Code for the frontend and Intellij for the backend.
  - Next you well need MySQL Server on your machine. MySQL user is defaulted to root and password as password. You can edit application.properties in Springboot with your own.
  - Finally you will need Apache Tomcat and Nodejs.
  - Clone the repo and start the frontend and the backend.

Simple Frontend Intilization:
  - Possibily a good idea to run 'npm install' on this repo to get dependencies accordingly.
  - 'npm start' will allow the front end to start.

Simple Backend Intilization:
  - You should run maven lifecycle commands clean and install.
  - Then you can build the application
  - Finally run application
  
  These simple steps should allow you to demo the application.
